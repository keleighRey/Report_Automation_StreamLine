intro,
"Dodge Creek in Portville, NY receives discharge from the Portville Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Dodge Creek (PWLID 0201-0065) is a Class C stream in the Allegheny River watershed. The Bureau of Water Resource Management requested that the Stream Monitoring and Assessment Section (SMAS) conduct monitoring to determine if potential impacts to aquatic life and water quality were occurring due to the STP discharge (RAS QAPP, 2021 ). Upstream and downstream sampling locations were selected to isolate impacts to aquatic life and determine whether significant reduction in ammonia limits may be required as part of upgrades to the STP. Biological impairment criteria sampling (Bode et al. 1995) was conducted along with collection of information on physical habitat, substrate information, and water chemistry.",
