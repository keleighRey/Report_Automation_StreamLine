intro
"Belleayre Mountain has proposed upgrades to the ski area and as part of its Unit Management Plan (UMP) is required to conduct water quality monitoring to document impacts of construction and long-term effects of a proposed snow-making pond. Five locations were selected to assess construction impacts and bracket the proposed pond location, sample upstream and downstream of the existing Pine Hill Lake, and to include local reference condition. A single visit will provide baseline macroinvertebrate community condition, habitat, substrate information, and water chemistry"
