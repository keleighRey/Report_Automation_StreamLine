intro
"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasingly a global concern because they pose a threat to human and aquatic ecosystem health and cause economic damages. Most HABs management strategies are focused on reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the lakes. However, lakes, bays, and coves can harbor different phytoplankton communities, including communities that shift between harmful and benign species, under similar nutrient loads or concentrations. Cyanobacterial HABs (CyanoHABs) represent a substantial threat to drinking-water supplies and safe recreational uses of freshwater resources in New York, including the Finger Lakes region. Toxins produced by some species of cyanobacteria (called cyanotoxins) can cause acute and chronic illnesses in humans. Aquatic ecosystem health also is affected by cyanotoxins, as well as low dissolved oxygen concentrations and changes in aquatic food webs caused by an over-abundance of cyanobacteria. Environmental factors that have been attributed to CyanoHAB occurrence include cyanobacterial community composition, nutrient concentrations, light conditions, water temperature, hydrologic conditions, and meteorological conditions. Yet despite a general understanding of factors contributing to CyanoHABs, many unanswered questions remain about occurrence, environmental triggers for toxicity, and the ability to predict the timing, duration, and toxicity of CyanoHABs. For these reasons, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), has developed a comprehensive monitoring strategy in three lakes that have recently been affected by CyanoHABs: Owasco Lake, Seneca Lake, and Skaneateles Lake."
