Biological assessments based on the macroinvertebrate community provide the ability to detect water quality problems that are intermittent, not detected, and/or underestimated by water chemistry sampling alone. These biological assessments of water quality are generated using calculated Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) scores (SOP #208-21). BAP scores are calculated by taking the average of five normalized 10-scale community metrics and assigning that score to a four-tiered system of impact category of non (7.5-10), slight (5.0-7.5), moderate (2.5-5.0), or severe (0-2.5) impacts see (Figure \@ref(fig:BAPfig); SOP #208-21). A final BAP score below 5 is associated with significant loss of biodiversity, functional organization, and ability to support a balanced community compared to natural conditions (Karr, 1991; Davis, 1995). A BAP score above 5 indicates that aquatic life in the sampled stream reflects that of natural conditions or only slightly altered from natural (Figure \@ref(fig:BAP)). Expected variability in the results of benthic macroinvertebrate community samples is presented in Smith and Bode (2004)."
