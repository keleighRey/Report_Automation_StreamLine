Assessments of the physical habitat were also collected to calculate the Habitat Model Affinity (HMA) (Table 3). HMA is an overall estimate of habitat quality which describes potential habitat stress on biologic community. The HMA is based on rankings of individual habitat characteristics on a scale from 0 (poor) to 20 (optimal) which are then compared to a statewide reference condition (SOP #208-19). HMA scores are used to make final physical habitat assessments; Natural (80-100), Altered (70 – 80), Moderate (60 – 70), and Severe (< 60). Results are described in terms of percent similarity to the reference condition. 

Habitat model affinity (HMA) scores and resulting final physical habitat assessments are presented below (Table\@ref(tab:Habitat-table)). `r if(sum(HMA_counts$Assessment=="Severe")>0) {paste("Physical habitat final assessments demonstrate that habitat may have been a factor influencing benthic communities at sampling locations where HMA scores indicate severely altered conditions. severe (n=", sum(HMA_counts$Assessment=="Severe"),").",sep="")}`
