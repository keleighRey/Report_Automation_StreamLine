DEC establishes water quality standards (WQS) and guidance values for many specific substances. Waters are classified for their best uses and WQS are set to protect those uses (6 NYCRR Part 703). The data presented below does not meet the minimum data requirements for a confirmed best use assessment^[Best use assessment confirmation is based on 1) whether data are core or supplemental indicators, 2) how many years of data are available, and 3) how many samples were collected. (CALM, 2021)] (CALM, 2021). For the best use assessment, please see [DEC Info Locator](https://gisservices.dec.ny.gov/gis/dil/) and factsheets^[ Compilation of the stateâ€™s Integrated Report and updates to WI/PWL ID factsheets occur during even (2022, 2024) years. Best use assessments and factsheets may not immediately reflect data generated in this report.] for individual WI/PWL ID segments (WI/PWL ID `r paste(unique(show_text_pwl),sep=",")`). 

Ambient water chemistry sampling included in-situ and lab measured water quality analytes (Table \@ref(tab:Analytes)).  A total of `r length(unique(chem.short$CHEM_PARAMETER_NAME))`   lab-measured and `r length(unique(in.situ.short$CHEM_PARAMETER_NAME))` in-situ water quality parameters were collected. Samples were collected by SMAS using the direct grab method (SOP #210-21, section 11.6). Water samples were sent for processing using a contract lab with NYS Environmental Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP) certification. 

Following sample collection, all data processing followed quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocols (SOP #102-20, and #110-21). Only data meeting the highest data quality standard were reported and used in this report. For water chemistry, an evaluation of the precision, accuracy, and completeness of processed water chemistry samples after lab analyses was performed following the methods detailed in SOP #102. Appendix I includes a compilation of all rejected data flagged by the process. Analytes that fell below the minimum detection limit (MDL) were replaced with 1/2 the MDL (Helsel, 1990). Where applicable, raw chemistry results were analyzed for excursions from state WQS and summarized using R programing software (R Core Team, 2017). All accepted raw chemistry results (in-situ and lab reported) with all applicable standards and excursion determinations accompany this report as Attachment I (excel file).

A total of `r n_distinct(chem.short$CHEM_PARAMETER_NAME)` lab-measured, and `r n_distinct(in.situ.short$CHEM_PARAMETER_NAME)` in-situ water quality analytes were analyzed in this study. Out of the `r nrow(chem.short)` lab-measured records and `r nrow(in.situ.short)` in-situ water quality records, there were `r nrow(temp5)` excursions from established water quality standards (6 NYCRR Part 703). `r if(nrow(temp5 >1)){paste("There were excursions in")}`
